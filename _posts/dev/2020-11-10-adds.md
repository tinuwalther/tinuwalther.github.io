# Active Directory Cmdlets

A short intruduction in some AD-Cmdlets.

## GroupMembership

The Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership cmdlet gets the Active Directory groups that have a specified user, computer, group, or service account as a member. This cmdlet requires a global catalog to perform the group search. If the forest that contains the user, computer, or group does not have a global catalog, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

````powershell
@{$($env:USERNAME)=(Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership -Identity $env:USERNAME | Select -ExpandProperty Name)}

Name            Value
----            -----
MyAccount       {Domain Users, Remote Desktop Users}
````

## Set new password

````powershell
Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity $env:USERNAME -NewPassword (Read-Host "Provide a new password for $($env:USERNAME)" -AsSecureString) -Reset
````
