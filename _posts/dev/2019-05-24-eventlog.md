# Read from Eventlog

We known two Eventlogs, Windows (classic) Logs and Application and Services Logs.

## Windows Logs

The cmdlets that contain the EventLog noun (the EventLog cmdlets) works only on classic event logs such as Application, System, Setup, and Security.

````powershell
$params = @{
    LogName   = 'Application'
    Newest    = 10
}
Get-EventLog @params
````

## Application and Services Logs

To get events from logs that use the Windows Event Log technology in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system, use the Get-WinEvent cmdlet.

### Filter on LogName

````powershell
$params = @{
    LogName      = 'Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational'
    MaxEvents    = 10
}
Get-WinEvent @params | Select-Object TimeCreated,Id,LogName,ProviderName,Message
````

### Filter on ProviderName

````powershell
$params = @{
    ProviderName = 'Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient'
    MaxEvents    = 10
}
Get-WinEvent @params | Select-Object TimeCreated,Id,LogName,ProviderName,Message
````

# Write your own Provider

````powershell
# run as administrator
New-EventLog –LogName Application –Source 'MWA'
````

# Write to Eventlog

````powershell
# run as non-administrator
Write-EventLog –LogName Application –Source 'MWA' –EntryType Information –EventID 1024 –Message 'Test'
````
