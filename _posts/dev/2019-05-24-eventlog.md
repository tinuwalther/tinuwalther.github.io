# Read from Eventlog

We known two Eventlogs, Windows (classic) Logs and Application and Services Logs.

## Windows Logs

The cmdlets that contain the EventLog noun (the EventLog cmdlets) works only on classic event logs such as Application, System, Setup, and Security.

````powershell
$params = @{
    LogName   = 'Application'
    Newest    = 10
}
Get-EventLog @params
````

## Application and Services Logs

To get events from logs that use the Windows Event Log technology in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system, use the Get-WinEvent cmdlet.

### Filter on LogName

````powershell
$params = @{
    LogName      = 'Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational'
    MaxEvents    = 10
}
Get-WinEvent @params | Select-Object TimeCreated,Id,LogName,ProviderName,Message
````

### Filter on ProviderName

````powershell
$params = @{
    ProviderName = 'Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient'
    MaxEvents    = 10
}
Get-WinEvent @params | Select-Object TimeCreated,Id,LogName,ProviderName,Message
````

### Filter on Ids

````powershell
$params = @{
    LogName   = 'Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational'
    Id = 4104, 4103, 4688, 7045
 }
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable $params | Select-Object TimeCreated,Id,ProviderName,Message
````

### Filter on Dates

````powershell
$params = @{
    LogName   = 'Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational'
    StartTime = (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)
    EndTime   = Get-Date
 }
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable $params | Select-Object TimeCreated,Id,ProviderName,Message
````

# Write your own ProviderName

You can write your own ProviderName (EventsourceName). Before that, test if the EventsourceName already exists.

## Test EventsourceName

````powershell
function Test-MWAEventsourceName{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [String] $EventsourceName
    )
    $ret = $false
    try{
        $ret = [System.Diagnostics.EventLog]::SourceExists($EventsourceName)
    }
    catch{
        $Error.Clear()
    }
    return $ret
}
Test-MWAEventsourceName -EventsourceName 'MWA-PowerShell-Automation'
````

## Write new EventsourceName

````powershell
# run as administrator
$eventlogname = 'Application'
$providername = 'MWA-PowerShell-Automation'
New-EventLog –LogName $eventlogname –Source $providername
````

## Write to Eventlog

````powershell
$eventlogname = 'Application'
$providername = 'MWA-PowerShell-Automation'
Write-EventLog –LogName $eventlogname –Source $providername –EntryType Information –EventID 1024 –Message 'Test new ProviderName'
````

## Remove your EventsourceName

````powershell
# run as administrator
$providername = 'MWA-PowerShell-Automation'
[System.Diagnostics.EventLog]::DeleteEventSource($providername)
````
