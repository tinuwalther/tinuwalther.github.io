## Import optional updates failed

You recieved an error "this update cannot be imported into Windows Server Update Service because it is not compatible with your version of WSUS".

Error 80131509 "some updates could not be imported".

### Solution

#### This solution would not work

````text
After clicking on the "Import Updates…" option in the WSUS console, an Internet Explorer window will open on the following URL: http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/...&Protocol=1.20

Before proceeding with importing the updates, change the "1.20" protocol value in the URL to the previous protocol value 1.8. The URL should look like this when you’re done: http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/...&Protocol=1.8
````

#### But this solution works fine

1. Change the default browser to Microsoft Internet Explorer
2. Change the default language for the browser to english
3. Install ActiveX-Control

#### Error 80131509 "some updates could not be imported"

Now it throws an error 80131509 "some updates could not be imported":

1. [Set strong cryptography](./FindModuleError.html) on .Net Framework (version 4 and above)
2. Reboot the computer
3. Start the WSUS Console, click Import updates

### Affected
